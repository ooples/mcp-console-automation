# MCP Console Automation - Publishing & Registry Guide

This guide will help you publish and list the MCP Console Automation server in various registries and directories to increase visibility.

## üìã Pre-Publishing Checklist

Before publishing, ensure:
- [x] All tests passing (`npm test`)
- [x] TypeScript compiles (`npm run typecheck`)
- [x] No security vulnerabilities (`npm audit`)
- [x] README.md is comprehensive
- [x] package.json has correct metadata
- [x] Version number is correct in package.json
- [ ] GitHub release created with changelog

## üöÄ Publishing to npm Registry

### 1. Prepare for Publishing

First, ensure you're logged into npm:

```bash
npm login
```

### 2. Update Version (if needed)

```bash
npm version patch  # or minor, major
```

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Publish to npm

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

**Note**: Since the package name is `@mcp/console-automation`, you need to ensure you have access to the `@mcp` scope on npm, or change the package name to something like `mcp-console-automation`.

### Alternative: Rename Package

If you don't own the `@mcp` scope, update package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "mcp-console-automation",
  // ... rest of config
}
```

Then publish:

```bash
npm publish
```
