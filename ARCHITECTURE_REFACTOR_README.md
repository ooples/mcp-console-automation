# MCP Console Automation - Architecture Refactoring Project

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive refactoring project with two primary objectives:

1. **Fix Session Management Issues**: Resolve "stream destroyed" and "Session not found" errors that were occurring with console automation
2. **Improve Architecture**: Extract the 64 protocols from the monolithic ConsoleManager.ts into a clean, maintainable architecture with proper separation of concerns

The project combines critical bug fixes with architectural improvements to create a robust, production-ready system.

## Current State

- **Codebase**: 10,000+ lines of working code with all 64 protocols embedded in ConsoleManager.ts
- **Status**: Fully functional but monolithic architecture
- **Protocols**: 64 different console/connection protocols (SSH, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, AWS, etc.)
- **Tests**: Working test suite that validates core functionality
- **Compilation**: Clean compilation with TypeScript

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Fix Session Management Issues**:
   - Resolve "stream destroyed" errors when creating sessions
   - Fix "Session not found" errors in MCP operations
   - Implement proper one-shot vs persistent session detection
   - Add comprehensive diagnostics for session lifecycle tracking
2. **Clean Architecture**: Extract protocols into separate files with proper interfaces
3. **Maintain 100% Functionality**: All existing features must continue to work exactly as before
4. **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript compilation with no errors
5. **Testability**: Ensure all functionality remains testable
6. **Maintainability**: Create code that's easier to understand and modify

### Non-Goals
- **No Feature Additions**: We are NOT adding new features, only reorganizing existing code
- **No API Changes**: External interfaces must remain identical
- **No Performance Degradation**: System must perform at least as well as before

## Technical Approach

### Phase-by-Phase Implementation
We will implement this in 10 sequential phases, testing after each phase:

1. **Phase 1**: Analyze existing codebase, implement session management fixes, and create proper interface definitions
2. **Phase 2**: Create BaseProtocol base class with session lifecycle management that works with existing code
3. **Phase 3**: Refactor SSH/Terminal protocols (SSH, Telnet, Serial)
4. **Phase 4**: Refactor Container protocols (Docker, Kubernetes, LXC, Podman)
5. **Phase 5**: Refactor Cloud protocols (AWS SSM, Azure, GCP)
6. **Phase 6**: Refactor Database protocols (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
7. **Phase 7**: Refactor remaining protocols (VNC, RDP, WinRM, etc.)
8. **Phase 8**: Update ConsoleManager to use extracted protocols
9. **Phase 9**: Comprehensive integration testing
10. **Phase 10**: Test real-world functionality (SSH to GitHub runner)

### Architectural Principles

#### Interface Design
- **IProtocol**: Common interface all protocols must implement
- **BaseProtocol**: Base class providing common functionality
- **Protocol-Specific Interfaces**: Each protocol type can extend base interfaces as needed

#### Key Requirements
- All protocols must implement the same core methods
- Error handling must be consistent across protocols
- Session management must work uniformly
- Connection pooling and keep-alive functionality must be preserved

#### File Organization

## Critical Success Factors

### Must-Have Requirements
1. **Session Management Fixed**: No more "stream destroyed" or "Session not found" errors
2. **Zero Regression**: All existing functionality must work exactly as before
3. **Clean Compilation**: TypeScript must compile without errors or warnings
4. **Test Coverage**: All tests must pass, including comprehensive session management tests
5. **Real-World Validation**: Must successfully connect to GitHub runner via SSH to debug autoscaler queue issues

### Quality Gates
- After each phase, run: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck`
- After each phase, run the full test suite
- Before final completion, test actual SSH connection to GitHub runner
- Each protocol extraction must maintain identical external behavior

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for each extracted protocol
- Integration tests for ConsoleManager with new architecture
- Regression tests to ensure no functionality loss
- Performance tests to validate no degradation

### Manual Testing
- SSH connection to GitHub runner server
- Verification that session management works correctly
- Error handling validation
- Connection pooling and keep-alive verification

## Implementation Rules

### Code Quality Standards
1. **No Separate "Improved" Versions**: Always modify original files directly
2. **Production-Ready Code**: No shortcuts or temporary solutions
3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Maintain existing error recovery mechanisms
4. **Documentation**: Code must be self-documenting with clear interfaces

### Git Workflow
- Work on clean backup codebase (current state)
- Commit after each successful phase
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Maintain single source of truth for each component

## Expected Outcomes

### Short-Term (End of Refactoring)
- Clean, maintainable codebase with separated concerns
- 64 protocol implementations in their own files
- Proper TypeScript interfaces and inheritance
- All existing functionality preserved

### Long-Term Benefits
- Easier to add new protocols
- Simplified debugging and maintenance
- Better code reusability
- Improved testability and reliability

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
- Breaking existing functionality during extraction
- Type conflicts between protocols
- Performance impact from architectural changes
- Integration issues with existing dependencies

### Mitigation Strategies
- Sequential implementation with testing after each phase
- Maintain identical external APIs
- Preserve all existing error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Use existing working patterns as templates for new structure

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- All existing tests pass
- Successful SSH connection to GitHub runner
- No performance degradation (measured via benchmarks)

### Code Quality Metrics
- Reduced file size of ConsoleManager.ts (from 10,000+ lines to manageable size)
- Proper separation of concerns (each protocol in its own file)
- Consistent interface implementation across all protocols
- Maintainable code structure
