- ✅ Configuration options (custom ports, IPv6, host key checking)
- ✅ Integration with ConsoleManager

**Key Features:**
- Tests both authentication methods with realistic scenarios
- Validates command execution and output capture
- Ensures session state persistence across operations
- Tests connection pool management under various conditions
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery testing

### 2. Session Management Tests (`session-management.test.ts`)

**Session lifecycle and resource management:**
- ✅ Concurrent session limits (enforcement, rapid creation/destruction)
- ✅ Session recovery after crashes (detection, cleanup, restart)
- ✅ State transitions (status changes, metadata preservation)
- ✅ Resource cleanup (processes, buffers, monitoring resources)
- ✅ Memory leak prevention (buffer limits, garbage collection)

**Key Features:**
- Tests system behavior under high concurrent load
- Validates proper resource cleanup and leak prevention
- Ensures graceful handling of session failures
- Tests state management throughout session lifecycle
- Performance monitoring and resource optimization

### 3. Error Detection Tests (`error-detection.test.ts`)

**Multi-language error pattern matching:**
- ✅ JavaScript/Node.js errors (stack traces, exceptions)
- ✅ Python errors (tracebacks, syntax errors)
- ✅ Java errors (stack traces, null pointers)
- ✅ C/C++ errors (segmentation faults, assertions)
- ✅ Compilation errors (across languages)
- ✅ Database and network errors
- ✅ Severity classification (critical, high, medium, low)
- ✅ Performance under high error rates
- ✅ Custom error patterns

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive error pattern library for multiple languages
- Intelligent severity scoring and classification
- High-performance error detection (handles 100+ errors efficiently)
- Extensible custom pattern system
- Recovery strategy suggestions based on error types

### 4. Load and Stress Tests (`load.test.ts`)

**Performance and scalability testing:**
- ✅ 50+ concurrent sessions (creation, management, cleanup)
- ✅ Memory usage monitoring (leak detection, efficient cleanup)
- ✅ Connection pool saturation (limits, recovery)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks (session creation speed, throughput)
- ✅ System recovery under extreme load
- ✅ Mixed workload scenarios
- ✅ Real-time performance monitoring

**Key Performance Targets:**
- Session creation: < 100ms average per session
- Concurrent sessions: Support 50+ simultaneous sessions
- Memory efficiency: < 10MB per session average
- Error detection: > 20 commands/second processing
- Command throughput: > 100 commands/minute per session

### 5. Mock Infrastructure (`SSHServer.ts`)

**Sophisticated mock SSH server:**
- ✅ Password and key authentication simulation
- ✅ Command processing (bash/shell commands)
- ✅ Session state management
- ✅ Connection management (multiple concurrent connections)
- ✅ Failure mode simulation (network issues, auth failures)
- ✅ Performance testing capabilities
- ✅ Realistic SSH protocol behavior

**Mock Capabilities:**
- Simulates real SSH server without external dependencies
- Supports common Unix/Linux commands (echo, ls, cd, pwd, etc.)
- Environment variable and working directory persistence
- Configurable failure modes for resilience testing
- Performance metrics and connection management

## CI/CD Integration

### Test Workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)

**Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline:**
