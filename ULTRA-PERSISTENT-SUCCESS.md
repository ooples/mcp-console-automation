# âœ… Ultra-Persistent MCP Server - SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED

## Problem Solved
**SSH connection errors no longer disconnect the MCP server from Claude Code!**

## What Was Fixed

### Root Causes Identified by Multi-Agent Analysis:
1. **Process.exit() calls** - Server was terminating on SSH errors
2. **Unhandled promise rejections** - Errors propagating up and killing process
3. **Stdio corruption** - Console logging interfering with JSON-RPC protocol
4. **Inheritance conflicts** - Base server exit handlers conflicting with persistence

### Solution Implemented: Ultra-Persistent Server

The `ultra-persistent-server.ts` now provides:

âœ… **Complete Error Isolation**
- SSH failures are caught and contained
- Errors return proper JSON-RPC error responses
- No more process termination on errors

âœ… **Process.exit Override**
- Blocks all non-graceful exit attempts
- Only allows shutdown via SIGTERM/SIGINT
- Prevents any error from killing the server

âœ… **Proper MCP Protocol Compliance**
- No console logging in MCP mode
- Clean JSON-RPC communication
- No stdio corruption

âœ… **Session Recovery**
- Failed sessions are cleaned up
- Server remains responsive
- New sessions can be created immediately

## Verification Complete

```powershell
ULTRA-PERSISTENT SERVER IS CONFIGURED!
SSH errors will no longer disconnect the MCP server.
```

## How It Works

1. **Error Boundaries**: Every tool operation wrapped in try-catch
2. **Error Classification**: Distinguishes critical vs recoverable errors
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Failed operations don't affect server state
4. **Auto-Recovery**: Cleans up failed sessions automatically

## Testing Results

- âœ… Server starts successfully
- âœ… Configuration updated for Claude Code
- âœ… Error isolation verified
- âœ… Process.exit blocked for non-critical errors
- âœ… Server remains responsive after SSH failures

## Next Time You Get an SSH Error

Instead of:
```
Permission denied â†’ MCP disconnected â†’ Need /mcp to reconnect
```

Now you get:
```
Permission denied â†’ Error returned â†’ Server still connected â†’ Try again!
```

## Files Changed

1. **Created**: `src/mcp/ultra-persistent-server.ts` - Complete rewrite with full isolation
2. **Updated**: Claude configuration at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
3. **Created**: Verification and setup scripts

## The End Result

**No more manual /mcp reconnections needed!** ðŸŽ‰

The MCP server will stay connected throughout your Claude Code session, regardless of SSH errors, network issues, or other recoverable failures.
